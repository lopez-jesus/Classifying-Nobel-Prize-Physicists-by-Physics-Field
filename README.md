# Classifying-Nobel-Prize-Physicists-by-Physics-Field
In this project, we will classify each Nobel Prize physicist by the physics subfield they practice.  To do this, we will gather and compare the words used in each physicist's Wikipedia entry to each physics subfield's Wikipedia entry to determine which subfield they are most associated with.

The .txt file, "Physicists-by-Field" contains the results of our classification. Each line lists a physicist, along with the physics subfield which we classified them in.

The .ipynb file, "Classifying Nobel Prize Physicists by Physics Field" contains the exposition and code to complete this project.
